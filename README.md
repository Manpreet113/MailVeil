# 🕵️‍♂️ MailVeil

> *Fake it till you make it (past the signup page).*

Welcome to **MailVeil**, your ultimate toolkit for surviving the internet without sacrificing your real inbox or sanity.  

We're done with tempmails that expire in 10 minutes, get blocked by every half-decent website, and look like they were coded during a panic attack.  
MailVeil gives you **masked emails with class**, powered by Mozilla Relay + ProtonMail + your sheer genius.

## 🧠 Wait... what is this exactly?

**MailVeil** is a system to generate *actual*, *usable*, *email-verified* burner accounts using:

- ✅ **Mozilla Relay masks** (those cute little proxy mails that actually work)
- ✅ **ProtonMail accounts** (secure, clean, and not insta-banned everywhere)
- ✅ A **recursive strategy** (every new email makes 5 new masks → infinite mails → infinite signups → you = god)

It’s like farming emails… but legal.  
And nerdy.  
And slightly evil.

## 🔥 Why MailVeil > TempMail

| Feature                | TempMail 🥴 | MailVeil 😎 |

| Real inbox access?     | Sometimes   | Always      |

## 🛠️ How Does It Work?

> This is the “I-have-caffeine-and-Redbull” version:

1. You create a Mozilla account (one time).
2. You get 5 Relay masks.
3. Each mask signs up for a ProtonMail account (email verified).
4. Each ProtonMail makes *another* 5 Mozilla accounts.
5. Rinse. Repeat. Profit.

So yeah… if you’re a little too into automation and emails, this is your Disneyland.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Vibe

If you’ve ever:

- Signed up for a site *just* to download a PDF  
- Used “1.1.1.1” DNS to feel elite  
- Made an alt email just for Spotify 3-month trials  
- Or said *"ye mail-vail bhej dena"* with your chest

Then MailVeil is your natural habitat.

## 💬 Final Words

Teach a man to veil his email, and he’ll farm infinite signups, never see spam, and become legend.”
